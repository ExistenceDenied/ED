# On line 1 we have what's called an "import." 
# This is how you add features to your script from the Python feature set. 
# Rather than give you all the features at once, 
# Python asks you to say what you plan to use. 
# This keeps your programs small, 
# but it also acts as documentation for other programmers who read your code later.

# The argv is the "argument variable," 
# a very standard name in programming, 
# that you will find used in many other languages. 
# This variable holds the arguments you pass to your Python script when you run it. 
# In the exercises you will get to play with this more and see what happens.

# Line 3 "unpacks" argv so that, rather than holding all the arguments, 
# it gets assigned to four variables you can work with: 
# script, first, second, and third. 
# This may look strange, 
# but "unpack" is probably the best word to describe what it does. 
# It just says, "Take whatever is in argv, unpack it, 
# and assign it to all of these variables on the left in order."
